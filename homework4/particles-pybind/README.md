## Exercise 1.2
`ParticleFactory::createSimulation` is overloaded, i.e calls different methods depending on call argument. In this case, it is use in a nested, russian doll kind of way: the method with signature `Func func` set the compute to the provided function and then call the barebone `createSimulation`.

## Exercice 2.2
we ensure correct management of the `Compute` object using shared pointers as object holder. It's a type of CPP smartpointers that allow object to be passed beyond the scope their defined, but count the references and delete the object if there is no more references attached to it, so we avoid memory leak or deleting twice the same pointer.
